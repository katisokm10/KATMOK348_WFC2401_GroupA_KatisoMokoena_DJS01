## Mars Climate Orbiter Challenge
This code is a debugging guide aimed at improving the readability, fixing calculation errors, and ensuring robustness in handling potential errors.

## Functionality

The code performs the following tasks:
- Calculates new distance based on initial velocity and time.
- Calculates remaining fuel based on initial fuel amount and fuel burn rate over time.
- Defines a function to calculate new velocity based on acceleration, initial velocity, and time.
- Outputs corrected results for new velocity, new distance, and remaining fuel.
